# Team Project Reference

Milestones

1. **Initial Proposal**

  The student must generate a written proposal for the project prior to beginning the work. This proposal describes the general scope of the work and a statement of the problem the project is intended to solve, which includes specific milestones, deliverables a tentative schedule.

  If this is to be a group project, the proposal should also address the expected division of responsibilities among the partners. This proposal will usually be about a page in length, although it could be longer depending on the project.

  You may start by answering the following questions.

- [ ] *What do you expect to learn from this project?*

- [ ] *Who is the target audience you expect to benefit from this project?*

- [ ] *What problem does it solve?*

- [ ] *What alternatives exist, and what are their strengths and weaknesses?*

- [ ] *What are their major features and differences?*

* Note: All the progress status should be reported/recorded through Git and GitHub.

* Note: Each team should specify the milestones (through GitHub Project -> Issues (tab) -> Milestones (tab next to Filters) -> New milestone. After adding the milestone, add issues corresponding to the planned events/tasks for the milestones.

2. **Implementation/(Weekly) Meetings**

  There should be a technical implementation component of the project. This can be hardware and/or software. The exact implementation required will depend on the specific nature of the project.

- [ ] *Clearly describe what has been done since the last update,*

- [ ] *Specifically address the status of the goals stated in the previous week/meeting's report, and,*

- [ ] *State specific goals for the coming week/meeting.*

3. **Demonstration**

  Some sort of demonstration of the final systems, languages, frameworks, etc. should be clearly presented.

4. **Report**

  There will be a substantial final project report required.  This report should describe problems encountered, solutions developed, dragons slain, etc.
